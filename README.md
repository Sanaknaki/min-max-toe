# MiniMax 


### A Brief History of the Minimax Theorem
  The minimax theorem was discovered by John von Neuman, in 1928 and was first mentioned in his paper titled, “Games of Strategy” or “Gesellschaftsspiel”. Since then, it has made major contributions to the development of science, mathematics and economics.
  
  In developing this theorem, von Neumann justified that game strategy is ambiguous when more than one player is involved. This is often because people are guided by self-interest, which leads to a somewhat unpredictable outcome (38). He argued that games are composed of a series of events that derive a “finite number of outcomes”. The outcomes of other events are based on the individuals’ free choice and utility; however, though it is ambitious to predict individual choice, it is possible to calculate the payoffs (gains and losses) of each player. This was done using a game tree compiled of players, nodes, edges and payoffs.
  
  John von Neuman and Oskar Morgenstern collaborated in the “Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour” in 1944, which proved the minimax theorem by using fixed points, linear inequalities and convexity (49) . This resulted in the minimax theorem and states that an optimal strategy exists in two player, zero-sum games. Though this theory was initially designed for game theory, it can also be applied to fields of economics. In 1932, the minimax theorem appeared in a mathematical-economic model to determine levels of production by implementing a production matrix to optimize the use goods and services. This was used to identify conditions for systems of linear inequalities (50).
  The minimax theorem of von Neuman had a large influence on the development of new systems in mathematics, economics, linear and non-linear programming and originated in connection with World War II (51).


### Application of the Minimax Theorem:
In the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, is a zero-sum two-player game that can be played using the minimax theorem. Essentially, the maximizer (let’s say player 1) aims to achieve the maximum value, whereas the minimizer (player 2) aims to minimize player 1’s payoffs, while maximizing their own payoffs. In conjunction with this, alpha-beta pruning is used to eliminate the number of nodes that do not influence the search tree. In class, we discussed pruning methods using backwards induction. Alpha-beta pruning is a prime example of how to eliminate options and rank each possibility by assigning a position and depth to each function. Essentially, alpha-beta pruning returns a static evaluation of each position to allow the AI to choose the optimal outcome. The higher the score, the better for the AI; the lower score, the better for the opponent.
